# Adding new versions
<Steps>
### Update the `meta.json` file
Open the `meta.json` file.
In this file, there should be an array with the name `versions`.

In `versions`, add a new object at the end of the array with the following properties:

`id`: The version id of your modpack (1.0.0, v15, anything, etc..)  
`releasedAt`: The amount of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.  
`promotions` (Optional): An object with the following properties:
- `downloads` (Optional): An object with the following properties:
  - `modrinth` (Optional): A link to download the modpack on Modrinth.
  - `curseforge` (Optional): A link to download the modpack on Curseforge.
  - `generic` (Optional): A download link that is neither Modrinth nor Curseforge.

Example:
```json
...
"versions": [
    ...
    {
        "id": "1.0.0",
        "releasedAt": 209384093820,
        "promotions": {
            "downloads": {
                "modrinth": "https://modrinth.com/",
                "curseforge": "https://curseforge.com/",
                "generic": "https://example.com/"
            }
        }
    }
]
...
```
### Create a new folder in the aforementioned file's root with the same name as the previously specified `id`
### In that folder, create a new file called `changelog.txt` and add the changelog to it.
Assuming the new version is called "1.0.0", the folder should look like this:
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="/" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="meta.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
    <FileTree.Folder name="1.0.0" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="changelog.txt" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
### Modify Modpack Update Checker's config so that `currentVersion` is equal to `id`.
